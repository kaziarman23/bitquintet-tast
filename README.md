# Bitquintet Frontend Development Task

## Overview

This project is a responsive HTML page built based on the provided Figma design.  
I used **Bootstrap 5** for layout and responsiveness, along with **custom CSS** where necessary to match the design closely.

The focus was on writing clean, semantic HTML5 and CSS3, ensuring full responsiveness across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Live Demo
